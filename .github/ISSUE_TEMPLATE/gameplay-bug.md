What did you expect to happen?

**Documentation**
Attach screenshots or REC files to illustrate the issue. A screenshot can be taken with the F1 key. A REC file contains the entire history of the fight and is very useful for debugging. A REC file can be dumped out at any time during a match using the F3 key. If the match has ended and you're in any other screen than the arena, F3 will dump a REC of the previous match.

**Platform (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. Windows, MacOS, Linux]
 - Version [e.g. 0.7.3, check the window title or the logfile if unsure]

**Additional context**
